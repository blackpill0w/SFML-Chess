# SFML-Chess
Chess in SFML v2.5.1 (C++14)

# Note
This was rewritten, this engine is slow and contains bugs, use [this engine](https://github.com/blackpill0w/Chess-Engine) instead.

# Dependencies
- SFML v2.5.1

# Build
`mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build .`

This produces two binaries, `server` and `app`.
The server should be running to play online.

# Note
- The app should be run from the root directory of the project.

# Todo
- Documentation.
- Fix filepaths problems.
